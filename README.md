This video showcases the key capabilities of **UrbanXplain**, a language-driven urban planning system that integrates large language model reasoning with real-time 3D simulation.

## ðŸŽ¬ Video Walkthrough

### 1. Initial Scene: Empty Blocks
The demonstration begins with a visual overview of the planning areaâ€”an urban space consisting of polygonal blocks with no buildings rendered. These empty plots provide the spatial canvas for LLM-based generation.

### 2. Instruction Input: Energy-Efficient Design
The user inputs a natural language command:

> `Design a commercial and residential mixed-use area prioritizing energy efficiency and low-carbon materials.`

UrbanXplain parses the instruction, infers appropriate zoning and material constraints, and generates a structured plan accordingly.

### 3. Auto-Generated Buildings
In response to the command, buildings are automatically rendered across the designated blocks. Each structure reflects functional zoning and sustainable design attributes derived from the LLM's reasoning.

### 4. Click-to-Explain Interaction
Clicking on any individual building triggers a text pop-up displaying its **design rationale**, including:
- Assigned function (e.g., residential, commercial)
- Chosen material (e.g., concrete, glass)
- Floor type and energy considerations
- LLM-inferred planning justification

### 5. Energy Consumption Mode
The system provides a visual overlay showing energy performance across all blocks. Blocks are color-coded on a green-to-red gradient, where:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green = Low energy use
- ðŸ”´ Red = High energy use

This enables quick inspection of sustainability across the layout.

### 6. Zoning Visualization Mode
A second mode highlights **functional zoning** using four distinct colors:
- ðŸŸ¨ **Residential** â€” `#F8D978`
- ðŸŸ¦ **Commercial** â€” `#A0D6ED`
- ðŸŸ© **Public** â€” `#C1E2A0`
- ðŸŸ¥ **Cultural** â€” `#F2A8A7`
This helps users understand spatial distribution and land-use clustering at a glance.

### 7. End of Demonstration
The demo concludes with a full-system overview, illustrating how natural language input leads to a transparent, explainable, and fully visualized urban design output.
